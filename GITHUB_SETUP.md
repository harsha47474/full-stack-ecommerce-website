# 🚀 GitHub Setup Instructions

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner
3. Select "New repository"
4. Fill in the repository details:
   - **Repository name**: `full-stack-ecommerce-website`
   - **Description**: `A modern, premium e-commerce platform with React, Node.js, and MongoDB`
   - **Visibility**: Public (or Private if preferred)
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
5. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Connect Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the repository on GitHub, run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Add the GitHub repository as remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/full-stack-ecommerce-website.git

# Push the code to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

## Step 3: Verify Upload

1. Refresh your GitHub repository page
2. You should see all your files uploaded
3. The README.md will be displayed automatically

## Alternative: Using GitHub CLI (if installed)

If you have GitHub CLI installed, you can create the repository directly:

```bash
# Create repository on GitHub
gh repo create full-stack-ecommerce-website --public --description "A modern, premium e-commerce platform with React, Node.js, and MongoDB"

# Push the code
git push -u origin main
```
